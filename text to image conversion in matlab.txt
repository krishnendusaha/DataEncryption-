***matlab code to convert the text file to image in bmp format*******

A=dlmread(filename,delimiter)      //reads the text file with name filename  and  reads the elements seperated by space delimiter(' ' )   saves the 256X256 pixel values in a matrix A in 
                                   //type  double 
A1= uint8(A)                       //converts the elements of A from double to uint8 and stores in another matrix A1 of size 256X256  
imwrite(A1,image_filename,format)  //A1 contains the image to be printed in matrix of 256X256 of uint8 elements ,image_filename contains the image name with location where the image will be  
                                   //saved, format contains the image format ('bmp')
